19 Starting Up Our New Django Project

If you follow the instructions exactly as written, you'll end up installing
some packages that are newer versions than intended, with breaking changes,
and you won't be able to continue with the tutorial.

In order to get everything working correctly, after executing Step 19.1 and
before executing Step 19.2, you must run the following commands:

- `pip uninstall setuptools`
- `pip install setuptools==60.5.0`
- `brew install libtiff libjpeg webp little-cms2`

After running those three commands, continue with Step 19.2 and the rest of
the tutorial.




29 Trying Out the Cheese Model

In Step 29.3, when instantiating a Cheese object, on the third line of the
description, DON'T TYPE THE FINAL COMMA AT THE END OF THE LINE.

The line should look like this:

                'creamy cheese that was first created in 1885'

with no final comma at the end of the line.




45 Finding and Adding a Third-Party Countries App

In 45.3 Check Django Packages, there is a step missing. After entering
`countries` in the search bar, you will find yourself on
`https://djangopackages.org/search/?q=countries`, which is not the page
in the screenshot in the book. In your search results, the top result
should be a package called "Countries", and the description should start
with "Grid: List of packages". If you click on the package name, then you
should be taken to a grid page that matches the screenshot in the book.




47 Implement Cheese Creation by Users

In 47.1, we already have a `from django.views.generic` import line in our
`cheeses/views.py` file. So all we have to do is add `CreateView` to that
import:

```
from django.views.generic import CreateView, ListView, DetailView
```

In 47.5, and for the rest of the book, all of the screenshots of the app itself
have a fancier header (with a block of cheese image and cursive text) that we
don't have in our version. Oh well! ¯\_(ツ)_/¯




54 Test All the Cheese Views

In 54.3.3, the UserFactory import doesn't need its own line; just group it with
the other .factories import.

```
from .factories import CheeseFactory, UserFactory
```
