19 Starting Up Our New Django Project

If you follow the instructions exactly as written, you'll end up installing
some packages that are newer versions than intended, with breaking changes,
and you won't be able to continue with the tutorial.

In order to get everything working correctly, after executing Step 19.1 and
before executing Step 19.2, you must run the following commands:

- `pip uninstall setuptools`
- `pip install setuptools==60.5.0`
- `brew install libtiff libjpeg webp little-cms2`

After running those three commands, continue with Step 19.2 and the rest of
the tutorial.




29 Trying Out the Cheese Model

In Step 29.3, when instantiating a Cheese object, on the third line of the
description, DON'T TYPE THE FINAL COMMA AT THE END OF THE LINE.

The line should look like this:

                'creamy cheese that was first created in 1885'

with no final comma at the end of the line.
